## Testing
`pytest` is used for running tests, which can be added using `pip`.
To run tests, use the command `python3 -m pytest tests/`.

For the tests to work, make sure to create your own `.env` file from the included `.env.example` and link the path to your `proteinworkshop` folder for Hydra configs.
